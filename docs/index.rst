To log in to your WOW TV account, visit the official WOW website or use the WOW TV app if you're on a mobile device. Once on the homepage, click on the “Sign In” or “Login” button, usually found in the top-right corner. Enter your registered email address and password. If the credentials are correct, you’ll be redirected to your dashboard, where you can access all the services available in your plan.

It’s essential to ensure you're entering the exact email address you used during registration. If you’ve changed your email recently, use the updated one to avoid any login errors.

What if You Forgot Your Password?

If you're unable to access your WOW TV account login due to a forgotten password, don’t worry—it happens. Click on the “Forgot Password?” link on the login page. You'll be prompted to enter your registered email address. WOW will then send a reset link to your inbox. Follow the instructions in the email to set a new password and regain access to your account.

Make sure to check your spam or junk folder if you don’t receive the email within a few minutes. Also, use a strong and unique password that combines letters, numbers, and symbols to keep your account secure.

Creating a WOW TV Account for the First Time

Some packages may require payment details during registration. Once your account is created, you can use the WOW TV account login credentials you set to access the platform anytime.

It’s a good idea to write down your login information or save it securely in a password manager to avoid future access issues.

Parents can also set up parental controls to ensure age-appropriate content for children. This can be done through the account settings after logging in.

Troubleshooting Common Login Issues

Sometimes you may encounter errors while trying to access your account. These could be due to server issues, incorrect login details, or internet connectivity problems. If you're sure your email and password are correct, try resetting your password. If the issue persists, clear your browser cache or try logging in from a different device.
